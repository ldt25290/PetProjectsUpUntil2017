### Why did I start this project?
One of the most common media that is produced and stored is the photo. Doing this project, I wanted to figure out how Photos library works and navigate into the uses of Photokit.

By mimicking Photos app UI/UX, I wanted to shed light on what kind of issues are involved in implementing UI/UX to myself.

View Controller custom transition is commonly used, but Iâ€™ve never done it before. By implementing it, I wanted to learn how it works, and learn how to establish efficient communication between view controllers by using Protocol.
