# A little bit about myself

## 1. What are my repositories about?
Aside from what I do at work, I’d like to study several other topics of interests of iOS.
Here are some test suites or workarounds to pursuit further study.

## 2. What are two of my main interests?
### (1) Learn How to build Great User Experience
An app is more than just a program these days. 
A great app makes you feel you are controlling a fine-grained real-world physical machine. It takes me by surprise for the fact that it does on a mere two-dimensional display. I’ve never seen such things like that. That’s why I was gravitated to building mobile apps. I’d like to push the frontier of what I do and learn more about what iOS is capable of. 

### (2) Practice Software Design skills
As a software engineer, I expect to learn how to design apps better, which I mean better testability and scalability. 
It’s actually easier said than done. I believe the fastest way to improve myself is to experience real-world complexities a lot.
That’s the main reason why I plan to start a few projects on my own. Some of them are finished; some in progress; some I haven’t started yet.



# PetProjects

What makes working on mobile apps intriguing is that it is easier to build great interfaces and user experiences.
I started some of these projects in my spare time to reproduce fascinating UI/UX myself that great apps feature, which often leads to gaining insights in streamlining the app structure and practicing modularity.
As for the other projects, I started to study iOS topics further such as AutoLayout, Core Data, Persistence, Background Networking, AV Framework, and other peripheral ones.
There are tons of project ideas going on my mind that I either started or not started, and you can catch a glimpse of it here in my Github.
