# PetProjects

What makes working on mobile apps intriguing is that it is easier to build great interfaces and user experiences.
I started some of these projects in my spare time to reproduce fascinating UI/UX myself that great apps feature, which often leads to gaining insights in streamlining the app structure and practicing modularity.
As for the other projects, I started to study iOS topics further such as AutoLayout, Core Data, Persistence, Background Networking, AV Framework, and other peripheral ones.
There are tons of project ideas going on my mind that I either started or not started, and you can catch a glimpse of it here in my Github.
