### Why did I start this project?
In iOS, AutoLayout is a huge issue, and notoriously tricky. There exist many different combinations of ways to accomplish a view layout and have it react to device orientation changes or device changes itself.
Documents don't tell me which one is a practical approach and get me the best result for one's own specific cases. AutoLayout is an issue that I myself have to dive deep into it, and produce my own decision tree.

In this project, I made a simple image cropper. With this, I wanted to bring a specific case where I need more than just the Interface Builder pure layout approach. That way, I hoped I could demystify how Apple is going with AutoLayout and learn what to do to get a specific result if device orientation change occurs.

To learn about the implementation and AutoLayout issue, refer to the comments in the code.
