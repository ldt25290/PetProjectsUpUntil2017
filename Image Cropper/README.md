### Comments
I’ve started this project in an attempt to study AutoLayout and Device Orientation Change Issues further.
Pure AutoLayout approach, or setting constraints using Interface Builder, is convenient, but not powerful.
I’ve wanted to tackle the case where layout of the view is being constantly changed to the point where pure AutoLayout approach can’t do.
In this project, I am using mixed approach when it comes to layout the views so that I can accomplish Image Cropper UI/UX.
