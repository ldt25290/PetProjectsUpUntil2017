# SamplePodcast

I’ve started this project in an attempt to reproduce Apple’s podcast app.
By re-engineering the app with real-world complexities, I think I can learn to practice Core Data further; learn AV Framework; learn RSS parsing; have profound opportunities to streamline the app structure, better UI/UX, and so on.

Keywords: Core Data, Predicate, UITableView, RSS Parsing, AV Framework, Network


# SampleInstaLayout

I’ve started this project in an attempt to reproduce Instagram Layout app.
Instagram Layout app offers intuitive UI/UX to create a distinct layout with the photos of your choice.
I’ve always wanted to implement it on my own to push my frontier further in terms of providing better UI/UX.

Keywords: AutoLayout, Anchor Constraints, UIScrollView, UIPangesture, PhotoKit, UICollectionView, Image ContentMode, Snapshot, Subclassing, Delegate-Protocol pattern
